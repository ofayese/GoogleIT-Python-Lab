# Google IT Automation with Python - Practice Lab

A practice repository for the Coursera Google IT Automation with Python Certificate Program.

## What this is

This repository contains practice examples and exercises for the [Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation) on Coursera. The `pythonexample.py` script is a minimal example demonstrating fundamental Python concepts covered in the course.

## Files

- `pythonexample.py` - the example script that prints greetings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed and available on your PATH. On Windows you can use the `python` or `py` launcher.

## How to run (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in the repository folder and run:

```powershell
python "f:\\GoogleIT Python Lab\\pythonexample.py"
# or, if you prefer the launcher:
py "f:\\GoogleIT Python Lab\\pythonexample.py"
```

## Example output

When you run the script you should see:

```text
Hi Taylor
Hi Alex
Hi Pat
Hi Eli
```

## Purpose / Learning goals

This practice lab aligns with the Google IT Automation with Python certificate program objectives:

- Demonstrate basic Python syntax and data structures (lists)
- Practice using loops and control flow
- Understand string manipulation and output
- Build foundation for more complex automation scripts

These fundamentals are covered in Course 1: "Crash Course on Python" of the certificate program.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `python: command not found`, install Python from <https://www.python.org/> and ensure it is added to your PATH.
- If the script prints nothing or errors, open `pythonexample.py` and confirm the file contents are unchanged.

## Contributing

This is a practice repository for learning. Feel free to:

- Add more Python examples as you progress through the certificate courses
- Implement concepts from the Google IT Automation curriculum
- Create additional scripts demonstrating automation techniques
